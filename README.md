Web Fundamentals PG1926

We had an amazing time. We learned web fundamentals with 1.500 attendees.

I had a great time and the audience was perfect I would like to thank DSC GAZÄ° for inviting me as an instructor.

They gave me a chance for being an example to young developers. I'm getting lots of questions and I'm trying to help everyone. I think I started a spark last weekend for those who are curious about becoming a web developer.
